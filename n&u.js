//Many people don't know the difference between NULL and UNDEFINED
let var1 //This is the form of making an UNDEFINED variable, or...:
let var2 = undefined 
//The DIFFERENCE between NULL and UNDEFINED is that null doesn't have a value, but UNDEFINED means that the value would be changed in the future.
let var3 = null //This is the unique form of making a NULL variable.

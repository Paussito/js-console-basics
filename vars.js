//In Javascript we have more than 2 types of defining a variable, but today we are seeing 2,
// LET and CONST
let var1 = "text" //This is the form of making a LET variable, the difference between "const" is that we can change the value of it after defining:,

var1 = 1 //This is how we change it value, we can change to a Boolean, indefined, etc...
var1 = true 
//----------//
const var2 = "const var" //This is the form of making a CONST variable, this can't be changed in the future.

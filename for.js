//For is very useful if we want to repeat a code a determinated number of times, is like while but with numbers.
//Structure:
for (starting;/*used for starting the loop*/ condition; /*a boolean in an expresion*/ update /*the action to do*/) {
    // code
}

//------------//

for (let number = 1; number <= 10; number++) { //We set number value to "1" //If number is lower to 10 //We add one (++ means adding one)
    console.log(number) //We print it
}
